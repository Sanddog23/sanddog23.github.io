Captain David’s spaceship comes flying towards the enormous alien ship which have already led to destruction of parts of his home planet in demand for resources. The alien ship begins to fire at Captain David, who can dodge most of the shots, but eventually gets hit on his left wing. He tries to fallback, but he cannot escape from the ship’s gravity because of its size. Instead he pushes forward to the ship with a smile as he brought a special weapon onboard the ship. Realizing this may be a one-way ticket ride, he fires the weapon at the ship and then a huge flash of light erupts along with a big ball of fire as the alien ship explodes. Shouting cheerfully is Captain David still alive. He is excited to give back good news and starts his way back to his planet with stars flashing behind him.</p>

                              <p style="color:black;">When it comes to portraying science, much like the scene above, most science fiction films do a poor job. This can be due to many reasons with a few to name including just to make a good plot, to appeal to the eye, or to mean a metaphor for something philosophical. However, there have been to many times in seeing these films in which I shake my head at this portrayal and I am sure I am not the only one doing so. Don’t get me wrong with not liking science fiction films though, I have watched plenty throughout my childhood and continue to do so. These films have even helped encouraged my interest in science, even though they have also filled my head with a lot junk. So, to urge everybody to take a step back when watching these films and question everything, I have compiled a list of misconceptions particularly in the realm of space. Before explaining these misconceptions, I will first analyze a couple of films to explain what areas of the films are technically wrong to give perspective of this portrayal of science. After explaining the misconceptions, I will then explain the pros and cons of incorporating these misconceptions in science fiction. Hopefully then this will help you become a more technical viewer.

                                  <p style="color:black; text-indent: 0%;">If there was one science fiction film that could very well describe the state of science fiction back during this time period, this is it. Essentially the story behind this film is that a team of astronauts get sent to the Moon to initially discover deposits of a new element but end up helping save an alien race which just so happens to land on the Moon. This film overall had some serious disregard for incorporating real fact into the story. The first issue I noticed is when the astronauts first took off into space on board the rocket. Real astronauts experience roughly three g’s of force upon take off, which is three times the amount of gravity exertion then normal gravity. The astronauts in the film, however, didn’t even move a muscle when they took off. Another issue I had throughout the film was the depiction of the aliens and how closely similar they were to humans. They even had an alien who was very ill due to Leukemia which is a human described type of cancer. How can an alien have a human illness given the expected biological differences? The only part that I felt somewhat of an agreement on was the aliens use of their robots. They use them for day to day to operations and dangerous situations much like how robots are used today. However, the dangerous situations in portrayed in the film included laser beam destruction which would require a huge amount of energy which for the robot’s size is highly improbable. Ultimately, it was clear this film was solely for the purpose of entertainment.</p>

                                  <p style="color:black; text-indent: 0%;">This film was unique compared to most for both the plot and the visual design, though there were many technical terms discussed that were given the completely wrong context. The story behind this film was how a human expedition team in space received a distress signal emanating from an unexplored planet. They then approach the planet and are sucked into its gravitational pull. Once landed a mysterious force takes over the crew and they attack each other. Eventually they break free from the force and find that alien beings are taking over their bodies. The aliens eventually take over the dead corpses of the people that didn’t make the landing and other crew members. These aliens are in fact trying to escape their dying planet and towards the end take the ship and leave with no human survivors. Right off the gate multiple red flags are present in the beginning scenes. The first one is the fact that there is artificial gravity present on the ship in space without rotation. The idea of having this synthetic gravity is impossible according to our understanding.  The next flag is the communications between the two ships in which they state they are two parsecs from each other when even though they are both in orbit of the same planet. A parsec is equal to about 3.26 light years which makes that communication scene impossible. Plus, there would be major latency in communications at this distance. Another flag was a scene when a crew member escaped the ship onto the unknown planet and then was immediately brought back onto the ship. There would be major quarantine protocols issued before somebody could just walk back in a ship like that. Even though the film did present certain technical terms to seem realistic, the context in which the film used them was unorthodox overall.

                          <div class="justifytext" style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%;">
                              <p style="color:black; text-indent: 0%;">An artificial gravity environment is portrayed in a lot of films in science fiction and which has no confirmed methods of producing this other than incorporating mass or acceleration. Take for example the artificial gravity present in Star Wars, Star Trek, and Battlestar Galactica. There is no outside force for acting upon these ships, it is just there. This breaks Newton’s laws of gravity as a ship in space would essentially need the mass of the Earth to simulate Earth’s gravity. So, the only practical solution portrayed in some science fiction films is the use of rotation. The rotation idea is simple and is much like a carousel at a park. When something is spinning from a center axis of origin it experiences a centrifugal force which is directed away from the origin. So, if the rotation is right and the distance from the origin is right then a ship can simulate a centrifugal force that is like 1g. An example of this rotating ship idea is most notably seen in 2001: A Space Odyssey and Interstellar. There are many more portrayals of this idea with complications as expected. Below is an interesting video which talks exactly about this idea.</p>

                          <div class="justifytext" style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%;">
                              <p style="color:black; text-indent: 0%;">The term zero-gravity is generally misunderstood. Usually when the term zero-gravity is used, it is implying how objects are weightless in space. This weightlessness is true, but the term zero-gravity is not possible. Everything experiences a force of gravity with numbers that are incredibly small to neglect, to numbers that are big enough to consider the effects. The more correct term that should be used is microgravity which just refers to very small effects of gravity. Many science fiction films show the weightlessness effects towards objects, but sometimes don’t complete a transition correctly from say entering an air lock into a ship from space. Once a person enters a ship from a microgravity environment and closes the air lock, there is this magical switch of gravity that turns on.  This is incorrect as the person would remain weightless in the airlock. Again, there is this misconception of having an artificial gravity on board a ship. Below are two film clips showing the incorrect and correct representation of this air lock scene. The incorrect represenation is from the film Wall-E and the other film is from 2001: A Space Odyssey.</p>

                              <p style="color:black; text-indent: 0%;">When it comes to communicating with aliens and humans, there is this depiction of straightforward communication that is both clear and unsophisticated between the two parties. This could have the potential of being true, but the likelihood of aliens understanding human language and humans doing the same is small. This is mainly due to the large possibility of the aliens being biologically different than us which in turn could lead to both a language barrier and intelligence barrier. For a language barrier imagine that the aliens possess the same intellect as humans do. However, in trying to communicate the notion of birth or death from the human standpoint, maybe the aliens don’t reproduce or don’t die and so trying to communicate this would demand clarification. Though, how would one provide this clarification then if both parties perceptions are vastly different? For the intelligence barrier imagine that aliens are beyond our intellect. Humans could possibly only understand the intentions of a communication message but will ultimately lack to understand what the aliens are meaning to say. Much like a human talking to a dog in which the dog can understand when it has done something wrong but will not understand how to change a channel on a TV. An important science fiction film that does a good job on representing both these barriers is Arrival. This film showcases the probable steps that humans would go through to establish some form of communication with aliens. A video discussing this film and what steps are being taken today to work on alien communication is below.</p>

                              <p style="color:black; text-indent: 0%;">In any science fiction film with long duration space travel, there is hardly ever the discussion about the radiation effects to humans and how they go about protecting themselves from this. Specifically, there are three types of radiation: particles in Earth’s magnetic field, particles shot into space during solar flares, and galactic cosmic rays. This radiation contains very high amounts of energy and thus are penetrating to thick and dense material. This type of radiation can pass right through a person which damages DNA. There are many ongoing efforts today to mitigate this amount of damage for astronauts in space today. A video clip shown below is from the film Fantastic Four in which they pass through what appears to be a solar flare event. Of the situation depicted here they would ultimately be dead rather than get superpowers. Plus, the shielding would have to consist of something more than a sheet of metal. However, where would be the fun if they didn’t get superpowers?</p>

                          <h3>Explosions and Sound</h3>
                          <div class="justifytext" style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%;">
                              <p style="color:black; text-indent: 0%;">We have all seen the massive explosions in space with huge fireballs erupting from a spaceship and the loud noise that comes about, but how exactly would an explosion work and sound carry without an atmosphere in space? Well the short answer is that they wouldn’t work as similar as on Earth. First, having a fire requires three elements: oxygen, heat, and fuel. These three elements are readily available on Earth, but not so much in space. What can be available in space is an oxidizer from a ship. An oxidizer is a type of chemical which a fuel needs to be able to burn. An oxidizer is typical to carry on rockets for example. So, a brief fire can exist until all the fuel is used up. With there being the capability of a fire then there sure is the capability of a huge explosion then right? Not quite. An explosion is essentially a rapid expansion of material which leads to the release of energy. This release of energy causes what is know as a shock wave here on Earth. This shock wave is caused by the rapid collision of particles on the surface of Earth. Without the same number of particles in space then essentially there would be no shockwave. Without a shockwave then there would be no sound since the principal of sound works by the disturbance of a medium. A more realistic explosion in space would be a brief spherical burst of light that would only blast shrapnel of the explosive outward and last until the oxidizer runs out. Below are two film clips showing the incorrect and correct representation of an explosion and sound in space.</p>

                          <div class="justifytext" style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%;">
                              <p style="color:black; text-indent: 0%;">The reasons for the many misconceptions that science fiction portrays through their films is countless. A film can be made for purely entertainment purposes or to mean something else entirely. Because of this focus, these films stretch from being plausible to imaginary to which then utilize science in a plausible and imaginary way. A film director in presenting this focus can examine the latest developments of science and technology or invent something impossible to carry on a plot or necessary commentary. Either way, the few misconceptions mentioned so far, and the many others have led to some pros and some cons.</p>

                              <p style="color:black; text-indent: 0%;">When you think about the new crazy ideas that get announced you can generally thank science fiction for those ideas. These fictious ideas portrayed in science fiction help to spark the imaginative minds of the people who have the technical knowledge to make the ideas a reality. Also, the misconceptions help allow conversations of certain issues across the world to get discussed by using science fiction as a metaphor. According to Menadue and Cheer, the metaphors used in science fiction help give an illustration for how human culture can be viewed to discover new interpretations regarding cultural, social, and scientific studies (13). Using this concept as a metaphor allows flexible thinking which allows us to consider the results of certain actions that we can take. Overall, the misconceptions lead to many possibilities for predicting the future for better or for worse and doing so allows us to reflect on the potential of these possibilities.</p>

                          <div class="justifytext" style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%;">
                              <p style="color:black; text-indent: 0%;">With all the misconceptions represented throughout science fiction there can’t help but be a misunderstanding of actual science. Now that films are being composed of highly sophisticated visual graphics which are intended to explore the public’s imagination, they ultimately are confusing the distinction between fact and fiction. According to Barnett et al., the National Science Foundation has even noted that today’s portrayal of science is harmful to the public’s understanding of science (180). Now by no means is this intentional by the film makers it instead just so happens that the audience takes what shown for granted. This is mainly caused due to the lack of exploring the actual science behind the narrative and having the necessary credibility of asserting if the misconception is indeed fact or fiction. To overcome these issues, I believe it can be tackled two ways. The first way is to convince film makers the need to produce scientifically realistic narratives and stray away from easily incorporating the impossibilities. The second way is to encourage the audience to explore the real science involved and question everything.</p>
